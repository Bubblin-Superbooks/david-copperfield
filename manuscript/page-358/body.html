He never liked me much, Peggotty; but he would rather not even see me now, if he can help it.’</p><p>‘Perhaps it’s his sorrow,’ said Peggotty, stroking my hair.</p><p>‘I am sure, Peggotty, I am sorry too. If I believed it was his sorrow, I should not think of it at all. But it’s not that; oh, no, it’s not that.’</p><p>‘How do you know it’s not that?’ said Peggotty, after a silence.</p><p>‘Oh, his sorrow is another and quite a different thing. He is sorry at this moment, sitting by the fireside with Miss Murdstone; but if I was to go in, Peggotty, he would be something besides.’</p></div> </div>
