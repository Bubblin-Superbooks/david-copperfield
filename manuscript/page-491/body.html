Some of them were most ferocious-looking ruffians, who stared at me as I went by; and stopped, perhaps, and called after me to come back and speak to them, and when I took to my heels, stoned me. I recollect one young fellow—a tinker, I suppose, from his wallet and brazier—who had a woman with him, and who faced about and stared at me thus; and then roared to me in such a tremendous voice to come back, that I halted and looked round.</p><p>‘Come here, when you’re called,’ said the tinker, ‘or I’ll rip your young body open.’</p><p>I thought it best to go back. As I drew nearer to them, trying to propitiate the tinker by my looks, I observed that the woman had a black eye.</p><p>‘Where are you going?’ said the tinker, gripping the bosom of my shirt with his blackened hand.</p></div> </div>
