I look back, once more—for the last time—before I close these leaves.</p><p>I see myself, with Agnes at my side, journeying along the road of life. I see our children and our friends around us; and I hear the roar of many voices, not indifferent to me as I travel on.</p><p>What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd? Lo, these; all turning to me as I ask my thoughts the question!</p></div> </div>
